REALISTIC TIMING UPDATE - CHANGES SUMMARY
================================================================================

✅ WHAT CHANGED:
----------------

1. RANDOMIZED DELAYS BETWEEN CLICKS:
   - Before: 1.5 seconds fixed delay
   - After: 3-7 seconds random delay (configurable)
   - Human-like variation

2. LONGER PAGE LOAD WAITS:
   - Before: 1.5 seconds after click
   - After: 5-7 seconds random wait after each click
   - Gives website time to load new content properly

3. SCROLL BEHAVIOR:
   - Added smooth scrolling to button
   - Random delays before/after scroll (0.5-2 seconds)
   - More natural appearance

4. INITIAL PAGE LOAD:
   - Added 2-4 second random wait after page first loads
   - Mimics human reading/browsing behavior

5. INCREASED TOLERANCE:
   - Changed MAX_CONSECUTIVE_NO_NEW from 3 to 5
   - Won't stop as quickly if content loads slowly
   - More patient with website delays

================================================================================
NEW TIMING CONFIGURATION:
================================================================================

Default Settings (Realistic):
- MIN_WAIT_BETWEEN_CLICKS: 3 seconds
- MAX_WAIT_BETWEEN_CLICKS: 7 seconds
- PAGE_LOAD_WAIT: 5 seconds (+ random 0-2s)
- Initial page wait: 2-4 seconds
- Scroll delays: 0.5-2 seconds

Total Time Per Click: ~10-15 seconds average
Total Time For 500 Clicks: ~83-125 hours (3.5-5 days)
Total Time For 100 Clicks: ~16-25 hours

================================================================================
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (Optional Customization):
================================================================================

You can override timing in .env file or export:

# Faster (still realistic)
export MIN_WAIT_BETWEEN_CLICKS=2
export MAX_WAIT_BETWEEN_CLICKS=5
export PAGE_LOAD_WAIT=3

# Slower (very cautious)
export MIN_WAIT_BETWEEN_CLICKS=5
export MAX_WAIT_BETWEEN_CLICKS=10
export PAGE_LOAD_WAIT=7

# Ultra-fast (risky, might get detected)
export MIN_WAIT_BETWEEN_CLICKS=1
export MAX_WAIT_BETWEEN_CLICKS=2
export PAGE_LOAD_WAIT=2

================================================================================
ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIMES:
================================================================================

With Default Settings (3-7s delays):

50 clicks:   ~8-12 hours
100 clicks:  ~16-25 hours
200 clicks:  ~33-50 hours
500 clicks:  ~83-125 hours (3.5-5 days)

Benefits:
✅ Less likely to be detected as bot
✅ Website has time to load content properly
✅ Should find more properties (no timeout issues)
✅ More stable, fewer errors

================================================================================
WHAT TO DO:
================================================================================

1. Push from PC:
   cd G:\THINK_SPAIN
   git add production_harvester.py
   git commit -m "Add realistic timing with 3-7s delays"
   git push origin main

2. On VM, pull and run:
   cd ~/THINK_SPAIN
   git pull origin main
   ./resume.sh

3. Monitor progress:
   ./status.sh

The scraper will now run much slower but more reliably!

================================================================================
LOG OUTPUT EXAMPLE:
================================================================================

✓ Click #1 - Show More clicked
  Waiting 6.2s for content to load...
  Harvested 50 new links | Total: 150
  Waiting 5.8s before next click...

✓ Click #2 - Show More clicked
  Waiting 5.1s for content to load...
  Harvested 48 new links | Total: 198
  Waiting 4.3s before next click...

You'll see the realistic delays in the logs!
