RESUME FIX APPLIED ✓
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROBLEM FIXED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
When resuming, the scraper was starting from page 1, causing it to see
all previously collected links as "no new links" and stop after 5 clicks.

SOLUTION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Now when resuming:
1. Loads saved progress (clicks_performed, property_links, consecutive_no_new)
2. Fast-forwards through already-clicked pages (1-2s delay, no harvesting)
3. Reaches the exact page where it stopped
4. Starts harvesting NEW content from that point forward

EXAMPLE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
First Run:
  - Clicks 30 times → Collects 150 links → STOP

Resume Run:
  - Loads: 30 clicks, 150 links
  - Fast-forwards: Clicks "Show More" 30 times (1-2s each, no harvest)
  - NOW at page 31
  - Starts harvesting from page 31 onwards
  - Finds NEW links that weren't in the 150 already collected
  - consecutive_no_new counter continues from saved value

CHANGES MADE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ load_progress() now loads consecutive_no_new counter
✓ run() method added fast-forward logic to skip already-clicked pages
✓ Resume goes directly to last position before starting new harvest
